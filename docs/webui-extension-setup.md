# Hermes WebUI Extension Setup

Hermes WebUI supports Gallery install for the Desktop Companion browser bridge.
For end-to-end Desktop Pet testing, install Desktop Companion from Settings ->
Extensions -> Gallery, then start the local companion runtime from this repo:

```bash
cd /path/to/hermes-webui-desktop-companion
npm install
npm run start:pet
```

`npm run start:pet` starts both the loopback sidecar and the native Tauri
Desktop Pet host. If the `desktop-pet` package dependencies are missing, the
script installs them first. Stop both processes with `Ctrl-C`.

`extension/manifest.json` lists the companion adapter script. It also declares a
descriptive loopback sidecar at
`http://127.0.0.1:17787/health`. This is the preferred path for WebUI builds
that include extension manifest support.

For local development against an older WebUI build or a checked-out extension
directory, manual extension mode is still available:

```bash
cd /path/to/hermes-webui
HERMES_WEBUI_EXTENSION_DIR=/path/to/hermes-webui-desktop-companion/extension \
HERMES_WEBUI_EXTENSION_MANIFEST=manifest.json \
./start.sh
```

The adapter calls the companion at `http://127.0.0.1:17787` by default. Override
it before the adapter loads if needed:

```html
<script>
  window.HERMES_DESKTOP_COMPANION_CONFIG = {
    endpoint: 'http://127.0.0.1:17787',
    heartbeatMs: 10000
  };
</script>
```

In normal Hermes WebUI usage, prefer leaving the defaults unless the companion
server is intentionally bound to another loopback port. This override is
trusted local configuration; do not point it at an untrusted remote origin
because the adapter sends authenticated WebUI attention state and executes
queued desktop-pet actions.

For convenience, this repo also includes a wrapper:

```bash
./scripts/start-webui-plugin-mode.sh /path/to/hermes-webui
```

The current plugin-mode milestone does not render a pet inside the WebUI page.
The extension hook only feeds the standalone Tauri desktop pet through the
loopback protocol.

The Gallery entry is not a native-host installer or autostart mechanism. It
installs the WebUI bridge; this repo still owns the local sidecar and native pet
host. `extension/extension.json` and `/health` expose descriptive management
metadata so WebUI can eventually show install, start, health, and Pet Gallery
actions without treating the extension install itself as native app install.

Installed macOS builds also register:

```text
hermes-desktop-companion://start
hermes-desktop-companion://gallery
```

The `gallery` link starts or focuses Desktop Companion and opens Pet Gallery /
Manager. Build the local `.app` with `npm run desktop:build`; for macOS
deep-link testing, launch or copy the app bundle before running `open
"hermes-desktop-companion://gallery"`. This repo does not currently publish a
signed or notarized macOS installer.

For older WebUI builds without `HERMES_WEBUI_EXTENSION_MANIFEST`, fall back to
the explicit URL-list configuration:

```bash
cd /path/to/hermes-webui
HERMES_WEBUI_EXTENSION_DIR=/path/to/hermes-webui-desktop-companion/extension \
HERMES_WEBUI_EXTENSION_SCRIPT_URLS=/extensions/companion-adapter.js \
./start.sh
```

To run the desktop pet while developing:

```bash
npm run dev
npm run desktop:dev
```

Use two shells: the first starts the companion loopback, the second starts the
native transparent pet windows.

To disable the extension, restart WebUI without the extension environment
variables above. To uninstall, stop the loopback and native host processes and
remove this repository clone.
