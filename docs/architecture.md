# Architecture

This project is split into three layers.

## 1. WebUI extension

Location: `extension/`

Responsibilities:

- load through Hermes WebUI's extension manifest mechanism
- derive lightweight attention from existing WebUI session APIs
- send a small browser/session snapshot to the companion loopback
- expose a narrow place for future companion actions

Non-goals:

- no WebUI Python routes
- no Hermes Agent source dependency
- no browser pet or WebUI overlay
- no broad DOM replacement
- no direct model, memory, tool, or permission changes

## 2. Companion loopback

Location: `src/`

Responsibilities:

- bind locally by default
- receive sanitized WebUI snapshots
- provide health and current-state endpoints
- later bridge to the native desktop host

The loopback protocol is deliberately HTTP/JSON for the first scaffold. It is
easy to inspect, easy to replace from WinUI, and does not require WebUI changes.

The sidecar is declared in `extension/manifest.json` with `type`, `origin`, and
`health_path` metadata. That declaration is descriptive until the main Hermes
WebUI repo ships a formal sidecar manifest contract.

If Hermes WebUI later ships an official extension backend bridge, this sidecar
can become the compatibility target or be replaced by that bridge without
moving desktop-only code into WebUI core.

## 3. Native desktop host

Location: `desktop-pet/`

The current native host is the Tauri shell migrated from Hermes WebUI PR #2916.
It owns desktop-only behavior:

- windowing
- tray/menu integration
- pet rendering
- local user preferences
- native notifications
- packaging

It treats the loopback protocol as its boundary with WebUI, not WebUI Python
routes.

The sidecar-served `/pet` and `/pet/bubbles` pages are native-window webview
content for the Tauri shell. They are not injected into the Hermes WebUI browser
page, and the WebUI adapter does not render an in-page pet.

The user-visible desktop pet experience requires both the loopback sidecar and
the native desktop host. The WebUI adapter alone is only the browser bridge that
publishes attention state and executes authenticated WebUI actions.

Pet skins and future pet packs should integrate at the loopback sidecar
boundary. The user-facing control is Pet Skin; a pack may use the built-in
display or eventually bring a custom display implementation behind that skin.
The WebUI adapter snapshot is the low-level state outlet, while the sidecar APIs
documented in `docs/pet-pack-contract.md`, especially `/api/pet/attention`, are
the normalized Desktop Companion surface. Displays should use one of those
contracted surfaces instead of scraping WebUI DOM.

Current startup flow:

1. The loopback sidecar starts on `127.0.0.1:17787`.
2. The native host loads pet windows, bundled skins, and user preferences.
3. Hermes WebUI loads the manifest-bundled adapter in the browser page.
4. The adapter posts snapshots to the sidecar.
5. The native host reads sidecar attention state and renders desktop bubbles.
6. Pet actions are queued in the sidecar and executed by the adapter inside the
   authenticated WebUI browser origin.

`winui/` remains reserved for a future Windows-native host if we later choose to
replace or supplement the Tauri shell on Windows.

## Compatibility rule

The WebUI adapter may use:

- documented Hermes WebUI extension loading and manifest asset bundling
- existing authenticated WebUI APIs
- stable browser primitives
- guarded internal WebUI globals while no formal extension runtime API exists

It should avoid:

- private WebUI module globals unless guarded and optional
- CSS selectors that assume exact message markup
- monkey-patching WebUI functions
- writing WebUI localStorage keys

The companion should declare required WebUI capabilities rather than relying on
only version numbers. Current capability names are tracked in
`docs/compatibility.md`.

## Current migration boundary

Migrated from Hermes WebUI PR #2916:

- bundled pet skin manifests and spritesheets
- the 8 x 9 spritesheet state model
- the Tauri transparent always-on-top desktop shell

Not migrated into WebUI core:

- `api/pet_routes.py`
- Settings and slash-command controls
- WebUI-owned Tauri launch/install routes
- browser navigation ack routes
- direct approval/clarify action submission

Those belong behind this companion project's loopback/protocol boundary if they
are reintroduced.
