# Extension Library Submission Shape

This repo is the source project for a future Hermes WebUI extension-library
entry. It should be submitted as a trusted local companion example, not as a
Hermes WebUI core feature.

## Proposed library entry

Name:

```text
desktop-companion
```

Description:

```text
Trusted local desktop companion for Hermes WebUI. Ships a manifest-bundled
WebUI adapter, a loopback sidecar protocol, and a native desktop pet host.
```

Suggested library contents:

```text
desktop-companion/
  README.md
  extension.json
  manifest.json
  companion-adapter.js
  pets/
    keeper/
    shiba/
    courier/
```

The library entry should point to this repository for the sidecar and native
host source instead of vendoring the full Tauri project into the library repo.

`extension/extension.json` is the PR #10-style author metadata source. It
declares identity, assets, shipped capabilities, sidecar metadata, purpose-based
permissions, and lifecycle behavior. `extension/manifest.json` is still kept for
today's Hermes WebUI loader, which consumes the minimal runtime manifest
directly.

The entry metadata declares only shipped capabilities today:

```json
{
  "capabilities": [
    "manifest-bundle",
    "loopback-sidecar"
  ]
}
```

It must not declare `sidecar-proxy` until Hermes WebUI core ships that
capability.

The metadata should declare the sidecar shape:

```json
{
  "sidecar": {
    "type": "loopback",
    "origin": "http://127.0.0.1:17787",
    "health_path": "/health"
  }
}
```

This is descriptive metadata. It should not claim that WebUI can install,
auto-start, proxy, or manage the sidecar until those contracts exist upstream.

The entry uses the PR #10 lifecycle split:

```json
{
  "lifecycle": {
    "webui_restart_required": false,
    "sidecar_start_required": true,
    "native_host_start_required": true,
    "native_host_autostart": "extension_owned"
  }
}
```

The injected WebUI assets do not require a WebUI process restart as an intrinsic
extension behavior. The loopback sidecar and native desktop host do need to be
started, and native-host autostart remains a Desktop Companion preference rather
than WebUI core state. Today's manual env-var setup may still involve restarting
WebUI so it rereads its configured extension manifest.

The source metadata may also include a management contract:

```json
{
  "management": {
    "version": 1,
    "install": {
      "kind": "external_url",
      "url": "https://github.com/franksong2702/hermes-webui-desktop-companion#first-time-setup"
    },
    "start": {
      "kind": "deep_link",
      "uri": "hermes-desktop-companion://start",
      "fallback_command": "npm run start:pet"
    },
    "manager": {
      "kind": "deep_link",
      "uri": "hermes-desktop-companion://gallery",
      "path": "/pet/gallery"
    },
    "health": {
      "path": "/health"
    },
    "actions": [
      {
        "id": "install_desktop_companion",
        "kind": "external_url"
      },
      {
        "id": "start_desktop_companion",
        "kind": "deep_link"
      },
      {
        "id": "open_pet_gallery",
        "kind": "deep_link"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

This contract gives WebUI a place to render explicit install/start/manage
actions. It is not permission to silently install native code or launch a
process. The deep-link actions require an installed native app; the fallback
command is documentation for local development.

## Install model

1. Install or clone this repository locally.
2. Start the companion loopback only when the user wants desktop behavior:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Start Hermes WebUI with this extension manifest:

   ```bash
   HERMES_WEBUI_EXTENSION_DIR=/path/to/hermes-webui-desktop-companion/extension \
   HERMES_WEBUI_EXTENSION_MANIFEST=manifest.json \
   ./start.sh
   ```

4. Start the native pet host to show and use the desktop pet surface:

   ```bash
   npm run desktop:dev
   ```

For source-built app validation on macOS, build the app bundle with:

```bash
npm run desktop:build
```

Launch or copy the generated app bundle, then trigger:

```bash
open "hermes-desktop-companion://gallery"
```

macOS deep links are registered by the source-built app bundle, not by the WebUI
Gallery entry. This repo does not currently publish a signed or notarized
macOS installer.

## Trust model

This is a trusted local extension:

- the adapter runs in the Hermes WebUI browser origin
- it can call WebUI APIs available to the logged-in user
- it does not render browser UI
- the loopback sidecar binds to `127.0.0.1` by default
- the sidecar is not a public HTTP service
- native desktop behavior stays outside WebUI core

The extension-library README should state this plainly before install steps.

## Why not WebUI core

Desktop companion behavior is useful, but not every WebUI user needs a native
desktop surface. Keeping it in the extension ecosystem matches the current
upstream direction:

- WebUI core remains curated and lean
- richer local workflows get a place to live
- desktop shell code does not add Tauri/WinUI complexity to WebUI
- future plugin backend APIs can absorb the sidecar protocol without reopening a
  large core PR

## Upstream dependencies to watch

- Extension manifest bundles: already supported by Hermes WebUI through
  `HERMES_WEBUI_EXTENSION_MANIFEST`.
- Extension status diagnostics: useful for install troubleshooting.
- Sidecar manifest metadata: proposed contract for Desktop Companion-style
  loopback helpers.
- Extension settings/status panel: future place to show sidecar health.
- Extension management actions: future place to render the manifest `management`
  install/start/Pet Gallery actions.
- Subprocess-isolated plugin backend API: future replacement or formalization
  point for the local sidecar.

## First PR recommendation

If `hermes-webui/hermes-webui-extensions` is still establishing conventions,
start with a small PR:

- add a `desktop-companion/README.md`
- include the `extension.json` source metadata
- include the runtime `manifest.json` only if maintainers still want the
  derived loader manifest checked in during the transition
- link to this repo for the source and sidecar
- document the trust model
- document compatibility and sidecar health expectations
- list the current limitation that backend behavior uses a local loopback
  sidecar until upstream plugin backend support is ready

Do not submit the full `desktop-pet/` Tauri tree as the first library PR unless
the maintainers explicitly ask for extension entries to vendor native hosts.
